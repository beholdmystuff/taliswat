You may turn any Objects you have into automated Followers:\n\
You may use the abilities and effects of your automated Followers as normal (Weapon and Armour limits still apply).\n\
Automated Followers are no longer considered Objects and do not count towards your carrying capacity.\n\
After you encounter a space and have drawn the required number of cards, you may discard an automated Follower to discard any number of cards on the space and draw new cards to replace them, which you must encounter.\n\n\
Whenever you encounter a Construct, you may take it as an automated Follower instead of attacking it. However, while a Construct is an automated Follower, you cannot use its ability.\n\n\

DEFSTRING(CHARACTER_CARD_CAT_BURGLAR,\
"SPECIAL ABILITIES\n\n\
Whenever you encounter a space with 2 or more cards, you may encounter the cards in any order you wish, instead of the order of their encounter number. If 2 or more Enemies have the same encounter number, they still fight together in the battle or psychic combat as normal.\n\n\
Whenever you visit a card or space that allows you to buy an Object, you may burgle instead. To do so, choose 1 Object that is available to purchase from the encounter, roll 1 die, and add the result to the Object's cost. If the score is equal to or lower than your Craft, you take the card for free. If the score is higher than your Craft, you must miss your next turn and discard the Object.\n\n\
