~Embroiled in an eternal sibling rivalry, the Twins roam around the regions in an attempt to gain favour with the gods, standing apart from each other's efforts until brought face to face with one another.~\n\n\
When Deimos is revealed, Phobos is drawn from the deck as well, then Deimos becomes frenzied.\n\n\
At the end of each round, Deimos moves 3 spaces clockwise and if frenzied; an additional space.\n\n\
The Twins alternate being calm and frenzied. If frenzied, their Strength and Craft values are doubled, and their effects do not take place. If either loses a life, it becomes frenzied and the other calm.\n\n\
If the Twins are ever across the Storm River from one another, they will exchange places, and whichever is frenzied will take a life from the other. Their temperament is then swapped.\n\n\
When characters in the same Region as Deimos trade-in trophies to gain Strength, reduce the number of Strength points needed by 1.\n\n\
If Phobos is killed, Deimos becomes permanently frenzied.\n\n\
If you defeat Deimos, take the Deimos' Wrath Beast Reward.")
