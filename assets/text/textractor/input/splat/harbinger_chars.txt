You begin the game with 4 Spells facedown on your character card. These Spells are your divine gifts. Your divine gifts do not count as Spells for the purpose of other effects and do not count against your Spell limit.\n\nWhenever you gain Strength or Craft and have 4 or fewer divine gifts on your character card, take the top card of the Spell deck and add it to the divine gifts on your character card.\n\nOnce per round, you may cast one of your divine gifts as if it were a Spell, though it does not count as a Spell for the purpose of other effects and does not count against the maximum number of Spells you may cast during a turn.\n\nAt the start of your turn, you may discard 1 of your divine gifts to draw 1 Spell.\n\n\
