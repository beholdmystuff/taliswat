During each of their turns, a character on the Crown of Command must encounter The King of the Dead. Each time The King of the Dead is defeated, remove one life counter from it. If the character is defeated, in addition to losing 1 life, they must place 1 life counter on The King of the Dead.\n\n\
If a character removes The King of the Dead's last life or successfully encounters him with a Talisman, they win the game! If another character has already removed some of The King of the Dead's lives, then a character only needs to remove The King of the Dead's remaining lives to win the game.")
