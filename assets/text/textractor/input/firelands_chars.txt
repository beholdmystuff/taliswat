When you defeat another character in battle you may take one of their Followers as a conscripted Follower, in addition to the normal reward.\n\n\

Instead of moving normally you may spend 1 fate to stay in your current space and encounter it. You cannot use this ability if you used it during your last turn.\n\n\

When your turn ends, you may spend 1 fate to draw 1 Spell, if your Craft allows.\n\n\
Whenever another character casts a Spell on you, your space, or one of your cards, you may either gain 1 fate or spend 2 fate to bind that Spell. If you bind the Spell it has no effect and you may immediately cast it on a new target, ignoring Region and timing restrictions. If you do not use the Spell, it is discarded.\n\n\
